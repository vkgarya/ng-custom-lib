You can use a custom registry either by setting it globally for all your projects

```bash
npm set registry http://localhost:4873
```

or by using it in command line as an argument `--registry` in npm (slightly different in yarn)

```bash
npm install lodash --registry http://localhost:4873
```

```bash
yarn config set registry http://localhost:4873
```
